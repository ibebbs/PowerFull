# PowerFull

A .Net Core utility for automatically controlling device power based on messages received from MQTT.

## Background

I recently authored a utility called [SolarEdge.Monitor](https://github.com/ibebbs/SolarEdge.Monitor). This utility is able to monitor solar generation and, optionally, electrcity import/export statistics from Solar Edge HD Wave inverters (import/export statistics require an additional [Energy Meter](https://www.solaredge.com/uk/products/metering-and-sensors/solaredge-modbus-meter#/)). Statistics gathered from the inverter and meter are published to an MQTT broker for consumption by a monitoring platform (I use [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/), [InfluxDb](https://www.influxdata.com/) & [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)).

In adition to being able to monitor solar energy production, I was keen to be able to maximise the use of electricity generated by the solar panels (lowering overall export) and minimize the use of electricity from the grid (lowering overall import). To do this, I realised that I needed a means to turn on devices when we start exporting electricity and turn off devices when we start importing electricity. And thus, PowerFull was born.

PowerFull receives "real power" readings from MQTT (positive when exporting, negative when importing) and publishes messages back to MQTT when devices should be powered on or off. While designed to my use case - i.e. receiving messages from SolarEdge.Monitor and controlling Sonoff devices flashed with Tasmota - it is extremely flexible through the use of configurable topic and payload settings.

## Usage

PowerFull is a .NET Core 3.0 application. As such it is run with the following command:

```
$> dotnet .\PowerFull.dll
```

When run like this you will see the following error:

```
One or more configuration errors occured:
The following fields must be specified when a Theme has not been specified: PowerStateRequestTopic, PowerStateResponseTopic, PowerStateResponseOnPayloadRegex, PowerStateResponseOffPayloadRegex, PowerOnRequestTopic, PowerOffRequestTopic
The Broker field is required.
The PowerReadingTopic field is required.
The PowerReadingPayloadValueRegex field is required.
The Devices field is required.
```

These configuration values can be provided via the command line or environment variables as outlined below:

### Device configuration
All the device configuration values support pattern substitition meaning they can be tailored to the specific device. For example, when the service is run with two devices named 'sonoff-battery' and 'sonoff-lights' with a PowerStateRequestTopic of '`cmnd/%deviceId%/POWER`', the power state request message will be published to the '`cmnd/sonoff-battery/POWER`' and '`cmnd/sonoff-lights/POWER`' topics respectively.

#### PowerFull:Device:Theme 
##### Value: null, Tasmota 

To save configuration work, Themes are provided to support common devices. At the moment only a single theme has been implemented - 'Tasmota' - to control sonoff devices flashed with the Tasmota firmware.

If you supply a Theme, no other device configuration values are required.

#### PowerFull:Device:PowerStateRequestTopic
##### Value: string - Required if Theme has not been provided
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `cmnd/%deviceId%/POWER`
The topic on which to publish a message requesting the current power state of the device.


#### PowerFull:Device:PowerStateRequestPayload
##### Value: string - Optional
The payload of the message published to the PowerStateRequestTopic used to request the current power state of the device.

#### PowerFull:Device:PowerStateResponseTopic
##### Value: string - Required if Theme has not been provided
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `stat/%deviceId%/POWER`
The topic on which to listen for messagings containing a response to the power state request message.


####  PowerFull:Device:PowerStateResponseOnPayloadRegex
##### Value: string - Must be a valid regex
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `ON`
The regex used to match an 'On' state from the payload of the message published to the PowerStateResponseTopic.


#### PowerStateResponseOffPayloadRegex
##### Value: string - Must be a valid regex
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `OFF`
The regex used to match an 'Off' state from the payload of the message published to the PowerStateResponseTopic.

#### PowerOnRequestTopic
##### Value: string - Required if Theme has not been provided
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `cmnd/%deviceId%/POWER`
The topic on which to publish a message requesting a device to turn on.

#### PowerOnRequestPayload
##### Value: string
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `ON`
The payload of the message published to the PowerOnRequestTopic used to request that the device turn on.

#### PowerOffRequestTopic
##### Value: string - Required if Theme has not been provided
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `cmnd/%deviceId%/POWER`
The topic on which to publish a message requesting a device to turn on.


#### PowerOffRequestPayload
##### Value: string
##### Example: 'Tasmota' Theme Value - `OFF`
The payload of the message published to the PowerOffRequestTopic used to request that the device turn on.
